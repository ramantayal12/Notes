## Running Databases with Docker (via Colima)

### Prerequisites

* **Install Colima:**
    ```bash
    brew install colima
    colima start
    ```
* **Install Docker (CLI):**
    ```bash
    brew install docker
    ```
* **Ensure Colima is running:**
    ```bash
    colima status
    ```

### Step-by-Step: Run Elasticsearch, MySQL, and MongoDB in Docker

We'll use `docker-compose` to define all services.

#### 1. `docker-compose.yml`

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.13.4
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
    networks:
      - backend

  mysql:
    image: mysql:8
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpass
      MYSQL_DATABASE: testdb
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: userpass
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    networks:
      - backend

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:6
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    networks:
      - backend

networks:
  backend:
    driver: bridge
```

#### 2. Run All Services

From the folder where you saved `docker-compose.yml`, execute:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Stop docker service 
```bash
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
```

To clean up all stopped containers and free up names:
```bash
docker container prune
```

### Access Your Services

| Service       | URL / Port          | Notes                 |
| :------------ | :------------------ | :-------------------- |
| Elasticsearch | `http://localhost:9200` | No authentication (for development) |
| MySQL         | `localhost:3306`    | User: `user`, Pass: `userpass` |
| MongoDB       | `localhost:27017`   | No authentication (default for development) |
